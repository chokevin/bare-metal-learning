# bare-metal-learning
Some of my own ai-written learnings of provisioning k8s on baremetal.

Take it with a huge grain of salt. This is all written by AI with some poking and prodding in different directions. Mainly used as a starting base of knowledge gathering. The words do not reflect how I personally understand the content but rather the direction the AI chose to go.
